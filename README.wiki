= TH:MyPagePlugin

== Introduction

Simple plugin designed to help you maintain a "journal" of your daily
activities with wiki pages. The main idea is to have a main navigation
link named //`MyPage`// which takes you to your "page of the day", in
edit mode.

If that page doesn't exist already, it will be filled with the content
of a PageTemplates, but with a twist: some tokens will be
automatically replaced, in particular for giving you the possibility
to include or refer to the previous page of the day...
 
The intended use is to have a quick but effective way to track the
ongoing activities of the day in the form of free wiki markup, and to
easily keep a continuity with the activity that occurred the days
before.

Works best with the TH:WikiExtrasPlugin and its WikiPhrases...

== Detailed mode of operation

When clicking on a //`MyPage`// top-level navigation link, one will
return to the edit preview mode of the "page of the day", which is a
normal wiki page of the form `/wiki/<userid>/<iso8601-date>`. If that
page doesn't yet exist, it will be created, eventually using an
appropriate page template (`PageTemplates/MyPage/<userid>` or
`PageTemplates/MyPage` - see PageTemplates).

(Technically, this is achieved by redirecting the `/mypage` URL to the
actual page of the day with `?action=edit`)

Moreover those templates can contain some special markup which will
get replaced by dynamic content when inserted as the initial content
of the page of the day. The macro `[[MyPageHelp]]` lists the available
tokens: [[MyPageHelp]]

This replacement will only happen when creating the //page of the
day//. If one wants to create such pages as normal wiki pages, retro-
or pro-actively, the page will start empty or using the normal
PageTemplates filling mechanism, i.e. no expansion of these tokens
will take place.
